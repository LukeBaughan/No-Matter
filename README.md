# No-Matter

Navigate a lone photon through space with the objective of reaching the plant at the end of the level.
This can be achieved by can clicking and dragging reflective objects into the photonâ€™s trajectory to change its direction of travel.
If the photon hits an opaque object however, the photon will be absorbed, and you will have to go back to your last checkpoint.
